/**
 * M4 Commit 3a — Slack Block-Kit template builder.
 *
 * Each `NotificationKind` becomes three blocks:
 *   1. `context`   — emoji + a short verb headline ("Apeksha assigned you …").
 *   2. `section`   — the task subject in bold, optional body underneath.
 *   3. `actions`   — a single primary "View task →" button that deep-links
 *                    to `${SITE}/t/<shortId>` (handled by the
 *                    short-link redirector route).
 *
 * The output is intentionally typed as `unknown[]` at the callsite — the
 * Slack SDK accepts any Block-Kit shape and we don't want to drag the
 * full `KnownBlock` union through the dispatcher.
