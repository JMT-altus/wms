-- Weekly Goals (Manan 2026-06) — a lightweight, fast-entry planner that sits
-- alongside Tasks. Each row is ONE priority a team member commits to finishing
-- inside a single Mon→Sun week. Columns mirror Manan's spreadsheet:
--   Sr. No. · Client · Subject · Priority for the Week · Incentive (y/n) ·
--   KPI (y/n) · Target Done · % Done (Actual) · Explanation (+ link).
--
-- Client + Subject are free-text mirroring tasks.client / tasks.subject so the
-- same WMS pickers (clients / subjects rosters) drive this surface too.
--
-- % done is employee-entered; admins may overwrite it. We snapshot who last
-- touched the percentage + when so the dashboard can show provenance.
--
-- Carry-over: copying a goal into a later week writes a NEW row whose
-- `carried_from_id` points back at the original — the previous record is never
-- mutated or deleted, so the history stays intact.
--
-- Idempotent: create-if-not-exists throughout.
