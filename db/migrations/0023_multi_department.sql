-- Multi-department membership — a person can belong to several departments.
--
-- Adds the `employee_departments` join table as the source of truth for
-- membership.  The legacy single-department columns on `employees`
-- (department text + department_id FK) are repurposed to mean the PRIMARY
-- department: exactly one membership row carries is_primary = true and is
-- kept in lock-step with those columns by the invite/edit server actions.
-- Every single-label reader (task rows, CSV export, status-table fallback)
-- keeps working unchanged — it now shows the primary department.
--
-- Also reconciles the canonical department list to the 11 JMT Drive Solutions
-- departments: renames "Hand Holding" -> "Handholding" and seeds the three
-- new ones (Founder Office, Social Media, CRM).
--
-- Idempotent: create-if-not-exists / ON CONFLICT / guarded renames so
-- re-runs are safe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Reconcile the department roster.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Rename the old free-text spelling.  Guarded so it's a no-op if the new
-- name already exists (avoids tripping the unique constraint on re-run).
update departments
  set name = 'Handholding', updated_at = now()
  where name = 'Hand Holding'
    and not exists (select 1 from departments d2 where d2.name = 'Handholding');

-- Keep the legacy text column on employees in sync with the rename.
update employees set department = 'Handholding' where department = 'Hand Holding';

-- Seed / re-order the canonical list.  ON CONFLICT re-activates and
-- re-orders existing rows so the admin panel + filter bar match the
-- business's department order.
-- No seed — the original Altus department list was removed during the JMT Drive
-- Solutions rebrand. JMT defines its own departments from the admin UI.

-- 2. Membership join table.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

create table if not exists employee_departments (
  employee_id   uuid not null references employees(id)   on delete cascade,
  department_id uuid not null references departments(id) on delete cascade,
  is_primary    boolean not null default false,
  created_at    timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (employee_id, department_id)
);

create index if not exists employee_departments_department_idx
  on employee_departments(department_id);
create index if not exists employee_departments_employee_idx
  on employee_departments(employee_id);

-- Backfill: every employee already linked to a department becomes a
-- primary membership.  ON CONFLICT keeps re-runs idempotent.
insert into employee_departments (employee_id, department_id, is_primary)
  select id, department_id, true
  from employees
  where department_id is not null
on conflict (employee_id, department_id) do nothing;

-- 3. RLS — read by anyone authenticated, write admin-only (mirrors
--    `departments`).  The app's server actions connect as the DB owner
--    and bypass RLS; these policies guard any direct Supabase access.
